    <h2>Unique Personality</h2>
    <p>Chanakya was an ancient Indian teacher, philosopher, economist, jurist and royal advisor. He is traditionally identified as Kauá¹­ilya or Vishnugupta, who authored the ancient Indian political treatise, the Arthashastra, a text dated to roughly between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE.<br> 
CHANAKYA-QUOTES <br>
      
A man is great by deeds, not by birth.<br>
      
Education is the best friend. An educated person is respected everywhere. Education beats the beauty and the youth.<br>
      
A person should not be too honest. Straight trees are cut first and honest people are screwed first.<br>
      
As soon as the fear approaches near, attack and destroy it.<br>
      
There is some self-interest behind every friendship. There is no friendship without self-interests. This is a bitter truth.<br>
      
The world's biggest power is the youth and beauty of a woman.<br>
      
God is not present in idols. Your feelings are your god. The soul is your temple.<br>
      
Never make friends with people who are above or below you in status. Such friendships will never give you any happiness.<br>
      
Once you start a working on something, don't be afraid of failure and don't abandon it. People who work sincerely are the happiest.<br>
      
Do not reveal what you have thought upon doing, but by wise council keep it secret being determined to carry it into execution.
